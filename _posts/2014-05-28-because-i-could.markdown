Tomorrow is May 29th. That is the day Star Citizen is hopefully going to make some dreams come true. I'm sitting at work all giddy and ready for tomorrow.
I still have to work, maybe ride a bike and eat before I can fully sit down and enjoy the alpha stages of a game to come. This game is something that needed
to be made for a long time; I've been wanting to play one of Chris Roberts' other games called Freelancer but I that was a a few years ago when I got that
running to be able to play on a server with roommates. I like to ramble. So with the really good chance it gets released tomorrow, I hope to go 'pew pew'.
