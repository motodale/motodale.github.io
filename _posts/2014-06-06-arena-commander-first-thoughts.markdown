First and foremost. Today we remember those who saved the world by storming the beaches in Normandy.

Arena Commander.  So far I have played about 3 hours total, and in those 3 hours I have encountered bug after bug:

* The worst bug I've had is loading in to the hangar and the cryengine locks up and won't let a player in. "Connection Error: Connection Lost"(or somthing similar)
  is the only thing that comes up.

  Turns out cryengine and teamspeak 3 and a windows service hate each other and the bug has been around for a few years. The explanation and fix can be found [here](https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/140453/a-possible-fix-for-windows-7-users-stuck-on-loading)

* Sometimes some of the larger asteroids show some artifacting

* A fun one happened where I got killed and respawned but the ship disappeared except for the weapons and engine and the power system. I have a screenshot somewhere I hope.

Aside from a few bugs, I found that the minigame was really fun. Tonight I play with a friends XBox controller to see how that works. I would like to try out a Hotas system for the immersion. I play on a decent gaming rig: i7 2600k with 8GB RAM and a GTX 570, nothing is overclocked at the moment but that can change pretty soon, once I find the time to do so. I haven't seen too many problems with playing on high or very high with it. I have been on medium for streaming over at [twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/moto_d) and it still doesn't look bad.

I didn't expect much with this update and it came with more than I thought it would. I love it. I seriously can't wait to see the Avenger in game now. I plan to be around for the weekend and streaming when I play too.
